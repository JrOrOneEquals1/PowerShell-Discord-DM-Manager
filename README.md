# PowerShell Discord DM Manager
## Description
This tool will go through all of your DM's on Discord and, if the specified key word is one of the unread messages, will send a specified message.  If there is an unread message that is not the key word, it will mark them as unread so you can read them later.  This is supposed to be similar to the discord.js script, but for DM's instead of server/channel messages.
## Installation
First, you will need to install Selenium for PowerShell from [here](https://github.com/adamdriscoll/selenium-powershell).  Then get main.ps1 from here into a folder, and open a PowerShell prompt in the folder and run main.ps1.  It will ask for all of the information it needs.
